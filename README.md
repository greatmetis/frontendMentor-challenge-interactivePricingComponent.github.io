ðŸ’¡ What do I learn from this challenge?
- pratically using prototype and objects to write Javascript.
- custom the slider (including slider thumb) through css

``` scss=
/*some codes above*/
&::-webkit-slider-thumb,
  &::-webkit-moz-range-thumb {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  background: $color--primary-strong url(...) no-repeat center;
  }
```

ðŸš© What I'd like to improve but haven't found the solutions?
- I am not too sure how 'this' work and when to use it is better. By creating script.v2, I felt my code could be much cleaner.
